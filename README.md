Hi, I’m Muhammad Hassan lodhi — a cybersecurity professional with 4+ years of SOC and SIEM experience (QRadar, LogRhythm, FortiSIEM, Wazuh) and expertise in XDR/EDR platforms (Microsoft Defender, TrendMicro).

🔹 Currently transitioning into Detection Engineering, where I design and validate detection logic to identify advanced threats.
🔹 Skilled in writing Sigma rules, KQL queries, YARA rules, and Suricata signatures, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
🔹 Passionate about improving detection coverage, closing visibility gaps, and strengthening SOC maturity.

📂 This GitHub showcases my work:

📌 Detection Rules (Sigma, YARA, KQL)

📌 Threat Hunting Queries

📌 Playbooks & Documentation

📌 Projects aligning with MITRE ATT&CK tactics

🌍 My goal: Build and share high-quality detection content that contributes to the blue team community while advancing my journey toward becoming a world-class Detection Engineer.
